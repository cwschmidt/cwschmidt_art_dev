<h3 id="terms-used">Terms used</h3>
<p>"Personal data" means all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as the "data subject"); a natural person is considered identifiable if he or she can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or to one or more special characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>"Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures in connection with personal data. The term is broad and covers practically every handling of data.</p>
<p>"Pseudonymisation" means the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not assigned to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p>"Profiling" means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
<p>"Controller" is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, decides on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>
<p>"Processor" means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
<h3 id="relevant-legal-bases">Relevant legal bases</h3>
<p>In accordance with Art. 13 GDPR, we will inform you of the legal basis for our data processing. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the data protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Art. 6 (1) (a) and Art. 7 GDPR, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our services and carry out contractual measures as well as answering inquiries is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our legal obligations is Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR, and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
<h3 id="security-measures">Security measures</h3>
<p>In accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, we take suitable technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the varying likelihood of occurrence and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
<p>The measures include in particular ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as access, input, transfer, securing availability and separation of data. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, deletion of data and response to threats to data. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings (Art. 25 GDPR).</p>
<h3 id="cooperation-with-processors-and-third-parties">Cooperation with processors and third parties</h3>
<p>If, as part of our processing, we disclose data to other people and companies (contract processors or third parties), transmit it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of legal permission (e.g. if transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, is necessary to fulfill the contract in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR), you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.).</p>
<p>If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called "contract processing agreement", this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="transfers-to-third-countries">Transfers to third countries</h3>
<p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs as part of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transmission of data to third parties, this will only take place if it is necessary to fulfil our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we only process or have data processed in a third country if the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR are met. This means that the processing takes place, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a data protection level corresponding to that of the EU (e.g. for the USA through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").</p>
<h3 id="rights-of-the-data-subjects">Rights of the data subjects</h3>
<p>You have the right to request confirmation as to whether or not data concerning you is being processed and to request information about this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR.</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, you have the right to request that the data concerning you be completed or that inaccurate data concerning you be corrected.</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, you have the right to request that the data concerned be deleted immediately or, alternatively, to request that the processing of the data be restricted in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR.</p>
<p>You have the right to request that the data concerning you that you have made available to us be received in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR and to request that it be transmitted to other responsible parties.</p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR.</p>
<h3 id="right-of-withdrawal">Right of withdrawal</h3>
<p>You have the right to revoke consent granted in accordance with Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with effect for the future</p>
<h3 id="right-of-objection">Right of objection</h3>
<p>You can object to the future processing of data concerning you at any time in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR. The objection can be made in particular against processing for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<h3 id="cookies-and-right-to-object-to-direct-advertising">Cookies and right to object to direct advertising</h3>
<p>"Cookies" are small files that are saved on user's computers. Different information can be saved within cookies. A cookie is primarily used to save information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is saved) during or after their visit to an online service. Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes their browser. Such a cookie can store, for example, the contents of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login status. Cookies that remain saved even after the browser is closed are referred to as "permanent" or "persistent". For example, the login status can be saved if users visit the site several days later. Likewise, the interests of users can be saved in such a cookie, which are used for reach measurement or marketing purposes. "Third-party cookies" are cookies offered by providers other than the person responsible for operating the online service (otherwise, if they are only their cookies, they are referred to as "first-party cookies").</p>
<p>We can use temporary and permanent cookies and explain this in our privacy policy.</p>
<p>If users do not want cookies to be saved on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. Excluding cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online service.</p>
<p>A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US website <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU website <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be achieved by deactivating them in the browser settings. Please note that in this case, not all functions of this website may be available.</p>
<h3 id="deletion-of-data">Deletion of data</h3>
<p>The data we process is deleted or restricted in accordance with Art. 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and there are no statutory retention periods that prevent deletion. If the data is not deleted because it is required for other legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons.</p>
<p>According to legal requirements in Germany, storage takes place in particular for 10 years in accordance with Sections 147 Para. 1 AO, 257 Para. 1 No. 1 and 4, Para. 4 HGB (books, records, management reports, accounting documents, commercial books, documents relevant for taxation, etc.) and 6 years in accordance with Section 257 Para. 1 No. 2 and 3, Para. 4 HGB (commercial letters).</p>
<p>According to legal requirements in Austria, storage takes place in particular for 7 years in accordance with Section 132 Para. 1 BAO (accounting documents, receipts/invoices, accounts, receipts, business papers, statements of income and expenditure, etc.), for 22 years in connection with real estate and for 10 years for documents in connection with electronically provided services, telecommunications, radio and television services that are provided to non-entrepreneurs in EU member states and for which the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) is used.</p>
<h3 id="comments-and-contributions">Comments and contributions</h3>
<p>When users leave comments or other contributions, their IP addresses can be stored for 7 days on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR. This is done for our security in case someone leaves illegal content in comments and contributions (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.). In this case, we ourselves can be held liable for the comment or contribution and are therefore interested in the identity of the author.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we reserve the right, on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR, to process user information for the purpose of spam detection.</p>
<p>On the same legal basis, we reserve the right, in the case of surveys, to store users' IP addresses for the duration of their survey and to use cookies to avoid multiple voting.</p>
<p>The data provided in the comments and contributions will be stored by us permanently until the user objects.</p>
<h3 id="comment-subscriptions">Comment subscriptions</h3>
<p>Users can subscribe to follow-up comments with their consent in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a of GDPR. Users will receive a confirmation email to verify that they are the owner of the email address they have entered. Users can cancel ongoing comment subscriptions at any time. The confirmation email will contain information on how to revoke their consent. For the purposes of proving user consent, we store the time of registration and the user�s IP address and delete this information when users unsubscribe from the subscription.</p>
<p>You can cancel your subscription to our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. We can store unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove that consent was previously given. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the previous existence of consent is confirmed at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="online-presence-in-social-media">Online presence in social media</h3>
<p>We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with customers, interested parties and users active there and to inform them about our services.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users because it could, for example, make it more difficult to enforce users' rights. With regard to US providers who are certified under the Privacy Shield, we would like to point out that they thereby undertake to comply with EU data protection standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created from user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on users' computers in which the user behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the user profiles regardless of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).</p>
<p>The processing of the users' personal data is based on our legitimate interests in effectively informing the users and communicating with the users in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f. GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective providers for consent to data processing (i.e. they declare their consent, for example, by checking a checkbox or confirming a button), the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a., Art. 7 GDPR.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the respective processing and the objection options (opt-out), we refer to the information provided by the providers linked below.</p>
<p>In the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we would like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the user data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.</p>

Integration of third-party services and content
Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use content or service offers from third parties in order to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter referred to uniformly as "content"). This always requires that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as be linked to such information from other sources.</li>
