## Welcome to my art page!

My name is Christian Schmidt. I live in Germany in the historial city of Regensburg in Bavaria.

Painting and drawing is a hobby of mine, since I was a little child. In the last few years, I intensified my efforts in this area to improve futher. I experiment with a lot of mediums, like oil, gouache and aquarell color for painting and also charcoal, graphite, color-pencils and oil pastels for drawing.

Until now, I only exposed some of my paintings and drawings mostly on my instagram page [@cwschmidt.art](https://instagram.com/cwschmidt.art). There, I don't only post my professional images, I did for myself, friends or as commission for aquaintances, but also some of my less professional sketches. Feel free to take a look!

Best regards,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian
